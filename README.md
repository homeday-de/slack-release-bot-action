## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Add a Slack webhook URL into your secrets (We, Homeday, have an application in Slack called Release BOT which has all the webhooks).

### Inputs

- `webhook_url` (required): the Slack webhook URL that will be in your secrets.
- `title` (required): the bold title to be used in the top of the message. From the example above: `v17.0.3 (2021-06-01)`.
- `body` (required): the message that describes the release. It will use Slack markdown so you might need to Slackify it first, see the examples below.
- `context` (required): the application that is being released. From the example above: `Homeday Blocks`.

### Example

```yml
jobs:
  my-slack-job:

          webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
          title: ðŸš€ v1.0.0
          body: This major release means that we are live!
          context: Slack release BOT
```
